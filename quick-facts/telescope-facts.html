                    <p>Sometimes the color in the images is as natural as possible. However, the color given to the images is not just artistic embellishment. The images are, indeed, downloaded as black and white, and color is added for a number of different reasons — for example, to show the location of chemical elements and highlight features so subdued that the human eye cannot see them.</p>

The data, which are transmitted from the telescope in digital form, need to be converted from this digitized information by computers into black-and-white photos. These are then enhanced to discern details in the images.</p>

                    Why do some Hubble images have a stair-shaped corner?

                    <p>The strange, stair-shaped images come from the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), removed from Hubble in 2009. WFPC2 consisted of four cameras, each of which took a picture of a section of the target. It's like taking four pictures of a single scene, then putting them together to create the whole picture.</p>
                    <p>But one of WFPC2's cameras took a magnified view of the section it's observing, to allow us to study that section in finer detail. When the images are processed, that magnified section is shrunk down to the same scale as the other sections, so that it fits into the image.</p>

The realization that the Milky Way is only one of many galaxies forever changed the way humanity views our place in the universe. But perhaps his greatest discovery came in 1929, when Hubble determined that the farther a galaxy is from Earth, the faster it appears to move away. This notion of an expanding universe formed the basis of the big bang theory, which states that the universe began with an intense burst of energy at a single moment in time and has been expanding ever since.</p>
