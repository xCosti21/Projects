The optical cameras on board have all been digital <a href="https://hubblesite.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-2834604b-61e4-4fcb-95d4-d3aaea74118d" target="_blank" class="answer-link">CCD</a> cameras, which take images as grayscale pixels but use colored filters to isolate different colors in each image.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the color in the images is as natural as possible. However, the color given to the images is not just artistic embellishment. The images are, indeed, downloaded as black and white, and color is added for a number of different reasons — for example, to show the location of chemical elements and highlight features so subdued that the human eye cannot see them.</p>

                    <p>No, Hubble cannot take photos of the Apollo landing sites. An object on the Moon, even the size of a large house, is too small to resolve.

The data, which are transmitted from the telescope in digital form, need to be converted from this digitized information by computers into black-and-white photos. These are then enhanced to discern details in the images.</p>

                    <p>The strange, stair-shaped images come from the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), removed from Hubble in 2009. WFPC2 consisted of four cameras, each of which took a picture of a section of the target. It's like taking four pictures of a single scene, then putting them together to create the whole picture.</p>
                    <p>But one of WFPC2's cameras took a magnified view of the section it's observing, to allow us to study that section in finer detail. When the images are processed, that magnified section is shrunk down to the same scale as the other sections, so that it fits into the image.</p>

In the 1920s, making use of relationships established by Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Dr. Hubble showed that some of the numerous distant, faint clouds of light in the universe were actually entire <a href="https://hubblesite.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-c9341de0-583b-43c7-81f6-8e9d528c521a" target="_blank" class="answer-link">galaxies</a> — much like our own <a href="https://hubblesite.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-e10fe068-b5cb-4a65-a72b-f7d3f85ff279" target="_blank" class="answer-link">Milky Way</a>. The realization that the Milky Way is only one of many galaxies forever changed the way humanity views our place in the universe. But perhaps his greatest discovery came in 1929, when Hubble determined that the farther a galaxy is from Earth, the faster it appears to move away. This notion of an expanding universe formed the basis of the big bang theory, which states that the universe began with an intense burst of energy at a single moment in time and has been expanding ever since.</p>

                    <p>Hubble is more scientifically productive today than at any time in its past, and NASA plans to operate Hubble at least well into this new decade.  Hubble's longevity is partly due to its multiple <a href="https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope/servicing-missions" target="_blank" class="answer-link">servicing missions</a>, the last one being in 2009.  That is when astronauts installed a new device, the Soft Capture Mechanism, to allow a robotic spacecraft to attach itself to Hubble someday, once the telescope is at the end of its life, and guide its descent to Earth or boost it to a higher orbit.</p>

                    <p>Newton thought that only objects with mass could produce a <a href="https://hubblesite.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-7b86cecc-7ddd-4935-bd6b-6427898de365" target="_blank" class="answer-link">gravitational force</a> on each other. According to Newton’s theory, the force of gravity should not affect light. Einstein discovered that the situation is a bit more complicated than that.</p>
                    <p>First, he discovered that gravity is produced by a curved <a href="https://hubblesite.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-a025fd2d-1078-4b24-82f1-c3163feb67ba" target="_blank" class="answer-link">space-time</a>. Then Einstein theorized that the mass of an object actually curves space-time. The stronger the gravitational field of an object, the more the space around the object is warped. In other words, straight lines are no longer straight if exposed to a strong gravitational field; they are curved.</p>
                    <p>Since light ordinarily travels on a straight-line path, light follows a curved path if it passes through a strong gravitational field. This is why light becomes trapped in a black hole.</p>

Each element interacts with light in a unique rainbow signature. The position and strength of those signatures in a spectrum gives scientists valuable information. STIS can take a spectrum of many places at once across the center of a galaxy, which tells scientists how fast the stars and gas are swirling at that location. With that information, the central mass that the stars are orbiting can be calculated. The faster the stars go, the more massive the central object must be.</p>
                    <p>STIS found, for example, the signature of a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy M84. The spectra showed the disk around the black hole is rotating at a velocity of about 250 miles per second (approximately 400 kilometers per second), equivalent to 900,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers) every hour. Earth orbits our sun at 18.6 miles per second (30 kilometers per). If Earth moved as fast as the disk around M84’s black hole, our year would be only 27 days long.</p>

                    <p>In his general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves. In 1916, his calculations showed that massive, accelerating objects would disrupt and distort space-time like waves moving away from a stone thrown into a pond.</p>
                    <p>The first gravitational wave signal was detected in September 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO).

The rings are made of dusty ice, with some pieces as large as boulders. These icy chunks gently collide with each other as they orbit around Saturn. Saturn’s gravitational field constantly disrupts these chunks, keeping them spread out and preventing them from combining to form a moon. The rings have a slight pale reddish color due to the presence of organic material mixed with the water ice.</p>

The globular clusters associated with our <a href="https://hubblesite.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-e10fe068-b5cb-4a65-a72b-f7d3f85ff279" target="_blank" class="answer-link">Milky Way galaxy</a> are typically composed of old stars, more than 10 billion years old. Hubble pictures of other galaxies sometimes reveal globular-like clusters containing young stars that are less than 50 million years old.</p>

                    <p>A <a href="https://hubblesite.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-1846f16d-cb38-464e-803b-695531eecffe" target="_blank" class="answer-link">supernova</a> is the explosive death of a star, which unleashes a burst of light through the cosmos. In 1987, a supernova observed in the nearby Large <a href="https://hubblesite.org/glossary" target="_blank" class="answer-link">Magellanic Cloud</a> (an irregular galaxy neighboring our Milky Way galaxy) was the first one visible to the unaided eye since 1604. Hubble was not yet in orbit when the explosion was observed, but it has since made dramatic observations of the expanding gaseous remains of that star. Although supernovas are rare in our galaxy, there are many galaxies and Hubble has observed stellar explosions elsewhere in the universe.</p>
